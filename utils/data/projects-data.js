        description: 'I contributed to the development of intelligent hospitality solutions, including an advanced AI chatbot enabling seamless hotel bookings via natural text and voice conversations. The platform integrates LLMs, real-time messaging infrastructure, and analytics tools to automate more than 70% of hotel interactions. I designed scalable backend microservices with NestJS and Laravel, handling over 200,000 daily API requests across multilingual platforms. I also built a serverless code generator in TypeScript on Cloudflare, reducing project initialization time by 70%. On the frontend, I collaborated with the Next.js team to implement GraphQL APIs and WebSocket channels, improving chatbot response latency by 40%. I architected a robust data infrastructure with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redshift, and integrated Elasticsearch and Kibana for full-text search and monitoring dashboards. I further developed real-time voice processing pipelines, implemented high coverage testing, and automated CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, reducing deployment times by 50%.',
